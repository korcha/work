          <article class="article_text">CoinKeeper will help you to sort through your personal finances, to control your expenses and to plan the achievement of some financial goals. 
          <p>Lots of people use CoinKeeper for various purposes:</p>
          <p>- Some use the app to know how much money they have on their accounts. In CoinKeeper, we call "account" any place where you keep your money, be it a wallet, a safe box or an actual bank account.</p>
          <p>- Some people study their monthly or yearly expenses history in order to optimize their spending and thus save money.</p>
          <p>- Some people plan their budget for certain categories of expenses - e.g., the sum that they plan to spend on foodstuff monthly. CoinKeeper can inform you how much money you can spend till the end of the month so that you meet your budget. It will help you to spend deliberately, to set apart out of your income and not to overspend. </p>
          <p>- Some people plan recurrent payments, so that CoinKeeper reminds about them.</p>
          <p>- People who have many income sources (e.g., freelancers), can log the receipts of funds so that they can check it when necessary.</p> 
          <p>- Some people use CoinKeeper to share family budget control and to log expenses from several devices. CoinKeeper enables them to use a common account.</p>
          <p>Further we will explore all app features in detail.</p>

          <h3>2. Main differences between paid and free versions.</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
          <p>CoinKeeper is a free service. You can use it free of charge; however there are some additional features which require premium subscription:</p>
          <p>- Free version offers only 7 expense categories and 1 income source. When you first start using the app, it creates several categories (sufficient for basic expense tracking). Premium version offers you a possibility to add new categories and subcategories, which ensures detailed expense tracking.</p>
          <p>- Premium version offers more options for expense statistics analysis. You can view your statistics for any period of time (e.g. for a year or during your holidays) and for any set of accounts.</p>
          <p>- Premium version users can save their data in a cloud and use them on several devices, which e.g. lets several people share their family budget.</p> 
          <p>- Premium version offers some more options, such as data export to electronic tables, selection of arbitrary budgeting periods, etc.</p>

          <h3>3. Get started</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
          <p>When you open the app for the first time, on the screen you'll see two areas, one of them showing "yellow" coins, the other showing "holes" for coins. </p>
          <p>Every yellow coin represents an "account"- that is, a place where you keep your money, e.g., your wallet, or bank account, or a credit card. </p>
          <p>Every hole is an expense category. This is what you basically spend money on. </p>
          <p>You can log expenses by dragging an account coin to an expense category and entering the sum on the screen that appears. The sum on the account will decrease by the entered sum, which in its turn will be added to the expense category sum. </p>
          <p>Here's an example, 
          You have spent some cash in a grocery store. It will only take some seconds to log it - just drag the "Cash" coin to the "Groceries" category and enter the sum. </p>

          <h3>4. More information about "yellow coins", or accounts.</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
          <p>In CoinKeeper, we call "account" any place where you keep your money, be it a wallet, a safe box or an actual bank account.</p>
          <p>Accounts in CoinKeeper are displayed as yellow coins. You can add an unlimited number of accounts. </p>
          <p>To add an account, tap on the circle with a "plus" sign to the right of the existing accounts.</p>
          <p>At any moment the account has a balance, i.e. the sum of money. This sum is displayed under the account icon. </p>
          <p>You can perform following account operations:</p>
          <p>- Spend money by dragging the coin to an expense category. </p>
          <p>- Transfer money from one account to another by dragging the coin to another coin (e.g. when you withdraw money in an ATM and put it into your wallet). </p>
          <p>— Add money from income source to the account when you earn money. </p>
          </article>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
          <h3>5. More information about "blue coins", or income source.</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
          <p>You get money from an income source, be it your salary, or renting out revenue, or anything else.</p> 
          <p>Income sources in CoinKeeper are displayed as blue coins. By tapping on the arrow icon in the upper right corner, you can hide or unhide the income sources area. </p>
          <p>You can drag income sources to accounts to "earn" money. In this case, the respective sum will be added to account balance. </p>
          <p>Under the income source icon, there are two sums displayed:</p>
          <p>1. The sum that you have received from this source this month. At the end of the month, this sum will be reset to zero (use settings to choose any period instead of a month). </p>
          <p>2. The sum that you plan to receive monthly from this source ("income budget”). You can change the budget by tapping the income source, and then tapping the "budget" field. You can skip setting a budget; in this case it won't be displayed. </p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
          <h3>6. More information about "holes", or expense categories.</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
          <p>Expense categories are what you spend money on. In CoinKeeper, expense categories are displayed as round holes in the bottom part of the screen.</p>
          <p>To spend money, drag a yellow coin of the corresponding account to the necessary expense category and then enter the required sum. This sum will be deducted from the account and added to the expenses in the corresponding category for the current month. </p>
          <p>Under the expense category icon, there are two sums displayed:</p>
          <p>1. The sum that you have already spent in the category this month. At the end of the month, this sum will be reset to zero (use settings to choose any period instead of a month). </p>
          <p>2. The sum that you plan to spend monthly in this category ("expense budget”). You can change the budget by tapping the expense category, and then tapping the "budget" field. If no budget is set, the budget sum is not displayed. </p>

          <h3>7. How to use budgets.</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
            <p>Expense budget is the sum that you plan to spend in a certain category. If you set these sums, you will always be aware how much you have to spend till the end of the month. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the budget can be used as a spending limit. Thus you can see the difference between the real and expected expenses and stop your spending on time if your goals require it.</p>
            <p>You can also set an income source budget, which corresponds to the sum that you plan to receive from the corresponding source. </p>
            <p>It isn't necessary to set a budget for every category, you can leave it empty. However, we recommend setting the budget for all categories, as budgeting increases financial discipline and ensures build-up of savings. </p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
          <h3>8. Why icons in the bottom part of the screen change their color so often </h3>
          <article class="article_text">
            <p>If budget is set for an expense category, this category has a "filling level", which shows the current level of category budget utilization. </p>
            <p>Besides, the category can change its color. If it is filled up with green color, you did bot exceed your planned budget. The red color indicates overspending (including too intense spending which eventually suggests that you won't meet the budget by the end of the month). </p>

          <h3>9. Reminders about recurrent payments</h3>
          <article class="article_text">
            <p>You can add the recurrence for an operation; in this case, it will be performed automatically every time when the indicated date comes. </p>
            <p>E.g., you can set a monthly payment for an app subscription, or for an apartment rent, etc.</p>
            <p>CoinKeeper will also send a reminder about the operation beforehand, so that you don't forget to perform it in reality.  </p>
            <p>You can add recurrence when you create an operation. To do this, tap and hold number “3” on the number pad and select the period in the menu that appears. </p>
            <p>In “Recurring Expenses” settings, you can set the moment, when the reminder about a recurring operation is triggered. </p>

          <article class="article_text">
            <p>Expense subcategories ensure a detailed expense tracking. E.g., they enable you to find out on what types of food you spend more, which institutions are more expensive and what kinds of expenses car ownership includes. </p>
            <p>You can select a subcategory while adding an expense operation. To add a new subcategory, tap on the icon on the right in the subcategories line. </p>
            <p>To view subcategories statistics, tap on the required expense category on the monthly statistics screen. You can first select a "Filter" and set a statistics period to view.</p>

E.g., when you have used CoinKeeper without signing in and added some operations, you might need to save these operations after you sign in your profile. In this case, choose "merge" to save the local data on the server.</p>
